The eclipse, like all matters astronomical, puts me in mind of humanity\\'s utter, cosmic insignificance. Read this thread. Contemplate how fossil fuels have shaped history &amp; how things might change if countries were energy self-sufficient. https://t.co/Qsh7PjrYUI Weakening/hedging its demands in hopes of attracting phantom center-right supporters is left\\'s biggest mistake of the last several decades. https://t.co/wtZp1TmMb0 1. Nobody reads Twitter on Friday afternoon, but I wanted to follow up on my post today by reinforcing one point: https://t.co/GeCtouLnsF In my lifetime. https://t.co/wPUSwWgfNz Climate change is going to drown their island. They\\'re entirely dependent on gov\\'t assistance. And they voted Trump. https://t.co/N5CHbXKvXH The GOP Congress is not going to pass a carbon tax. I am willing to wager literally any amount of money on this proposition. My new post: We have to bury gigatons of carbon to slow climate change. We’re not even close to ready. https://t.co/gawhLLvG3k I love love love @estellecaswell\\'s Vox videos on popular music. This one\\'s on \"gated reverb,\" the sound of the \\'80s. https://t.co/2b2hVTaxID My new post: Wind and solar power are saving Americans an astounding amount of money https://t.co/A12ITly0dY I understand the rationale for pretending to believe this, but Senate Dems don\\'t *really* believe it, do they? https://t.co/HqX4SrNSFp Y\\'all should go back &amp; read my piece on Al Gore &amp; his daughter Karenna. I think you\\'ll find it interesting. https://t.co/CNrWHlT11E Go on ... https://t.co/2a4CuVpyIj Go on ... https://t.co/8NMSkekYN1 1. A word about this insane press conference. It\\'s a very good time to remember this: https://t.co/FSK4DJ1hP8 Wingnuts are going to keep pushing until Pruitt challenges the endangerment finding, which will blow up in his face. https://t.co/DNfSPGKPnr Oh, great, the new chairman of @FERC is a believer in horseshit myths about \"baseload\" power plants. https://t.co/1bKc5WzWbN More Pruitt in the bubble. Maybe I should start a Pruitt In the Bubble Chronicles: https://t.co/zwBTml9woR No, I actually think that would make V2G easier -- more predictable, manageable fleet. But I\\'m not sure.

Pruitt &amp; staff will \"review it for accuracy.\" lol https://t.co/xq1Lk297tO And this is how they did it: https://t.co/ByZyLOpvF5 https://t.co/uUjk1pOeXf Key point from my post today: Pruitt is not a creature of Trump or unique to the Trump Era. He is today\\'s GOP. https://t.co/ltAagyIVnh My new post: Scott Pruitt is dismantling EPA in secret for the same reason the GOP healthcare bill was secret https://t.co/SktTPPji2t The relationship b/t liberaltarianism &amp; neoliberalism is quite interesting &amp; something I\\'d like to hear from @StevenTeles about. https://t.co/LRqZWfk1rV 1. It\\'s the weekend, no one\\'s reading Twitter, I\\'m waiting on a pizza to cook, so how about a tweetstorm on \"liberaltarianism\"? Al Gore &amp; his eldest daughter represent a generational split in the climate movement. I interviewed them both: https://t.co/CNrWHlBqa6 If you need another reason to read my Gore piece, how about this: it contains the word farkakte! https://t.co/CNrWHlT11E Rick Perry, America\\'s Chauncey Gardner, on getting a job he\\'s grossly unqualified for: \"God has a sense of humor.\" https://t.co/GSAT5l7urY I\\'m really enjoying @MattBruenig\\'s work at the People\\'s Policy Project.

It\\'s not the same Gore piece you\\'ve read a million times. https://t.co/CNrWHlT11E My new post: Al Gore still has faith https://t.co/JHwknwB19c What band/song/genre helps you write?

This piece from @emorwee is right on: https://t.co/qXW8MLDA0w Poor Nikki Haley. Trying to play the GOP \"moderate\" on climate leads to more nonsense than outright denial. https://t.co/35bmqCHDG9 1. This piece by @emilyhholden, about the contradictory forces pulling EPA Admin Scott Pruitt, is great. Tweetstorm! https://t.co/ypu3HZ73yL A new climate report will not corner Trump or \"force\" him to do anything. Why? Wait for it ... TRIBAL EPISTEMOLOGY! https://t.co/hF9UQrROgR My new post: That climate report didn’t leak and it hasn’t been censored. Still, things are pretty f’d up. https://t.co/ww8U8kJAJu Some day -- I\\'m not saying today, but some day -- you should read this post. https://t.co/ByZyLOH73F Across the world, people distrust atheists on moral grounds -- anti-atheist prejudice stronger than inter-religious https://t.co/5xJxOYxwEs Quartz has a fantastic visual depiction of the extraordinary, horrific damage done by the human search for coal: https://t.co/VJHzgmNPPJ My new post: No, city pledges to get 100% renewable energy are not misleading https://t.co/8kuktJxvpH Well, @Pickathon was amazing, yet again.

We continue to tiptoe around inequality when it comes to climate change.  https://t.co/uFMyTWf1Rx https://t.co/o4JtGq7MB4 A level of global warming most scientists consider unacceptably, terrifyingly high is now all but inevitable. https://t.co/o69Xzdwyku There are many areas of policy &amp; political strategy where the green team is insular &amp; blinkered and could badly use a red-team challenge. https://t.co/bIM92ljSij Scott Pruitt\\'s idea to use a \"red-team blue-team\" exercise on climate science is dumb. However ... https://t.co/Y5QvSHrl4y My new post: Pruitt’s \"red team exercise\" is a bad-faith application of a potentially good idea https://t.co/asYkOMuFe4 The top 4 candidates in Seattle\\'s mayoral primary are women.

As per the Darkest Timeline, the revolution has been ground down to \"barely better than nothing.\" https://t.co/6e40LrbTxo \"Paradoxically, therefore, as economics becomes more truly scientific, it will become less of a science.\" https://t.co/cfEsuwQ4ZS Very important thread on the factual disputes in DWW\\'s New York magazine piece on worst-case climate scenarios. https://t.co/UvCffTjSeZ As I trust climate scientists will now cease litigating policy, politics, &amp; communications, where they are way out of their depth. https://t.co/hO068HtBQr Yes. What the talk-softly crowd misses is that the tepid, polite, everyone-wins approach is inoffensive but also boring &amp; inert. https://t.co/464bq9WbPH My new post: It’s okay to talk about how scary climate change is. Really. https://t.co/UOOlaKoCOp Read this book: https://t.co/elTkhxUP68 https://t.co/a8f6h1C81h Yes. Without a sense of common purpose, small increments in CO2 costs won\\'t matter.

Never get tired of economists speaking to me like a child tho. https://t.co/I2Io1GLlby Whoa, I forgot I even wrote this! https://t.co/EW6CG0F8PL There are better &amp; worse outcomes possible. They hinge on what we do. What more do you need to know? https://t.co/S8Ryn4D2RL If we\\'re honest, we have absolutely no idea what would motivate the masses to demand change. Absent that, might as well tell the truth. https://t.co/JsMtuevTML Everyone on the left is an amateur communications professional. I suspect the net result for the left has been worse communication. This x100. There is a kind of off-putting mania among climate professionals these days to KEEP SMILING no matter how bad the news gets. https://t.co/bDykGHcYtE I want to see an explanation from an economist for how a carbon price can produce deep, rapid, society-wide change. Valuable perspective here. https://t.co/hbamwVXB5I \"So much more dying is coming.\" @dwallacewells is superb on our failure to grasp the true danger of climate change. https://t.co/PD9ZXMRKQq After 6 utterly abysmal Spider-Man movies (no, don\\'t defend them), we finally got a good one. Homecoming is an absolute delight. Ergonomic, but not mechanical. https://t.co/LdntB4mMbX Hm, never tried a fully split keyboard before.

Anybody know of one? My new post: Utilities fighting against rooftop solar are only hastening their own doom https://t.co/fiXuLzzmy9 That piece made an enormous impression on me.
